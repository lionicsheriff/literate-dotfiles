# literate-dotfiles
An experiment in dotfile management

## What?
A system to manage configuration files in a 'Personal Information Manager'

## Why?
I'm not too sure. I have never clicked with more file based solutions to dotfile management (e.g. symlink scripts, git repositories). I get the feeling that a dotfile is more than just a file that changes a program, but an opinion on a workflow. Since they are an opinion they belong with all the other personal information.

At the very least this is an approach I haven't seen before.

## How?
Currently I'm going to create a plugin for WikidPad that will use the attributes on a WikiWord to publish a page into the correct dotfile.
